# QR Codes Dataset

This is the dataset page of the images dataset related to the following paper:

**An Evaluation of Deep Learning Techniques for QR Code Detection**
*(by L. Blanger, N.S.T. Hirata, International Conference on Image Processing -- ICIP 2019)*

**Attention:** The dataset will be fully released as soon as we finish the user agreement terms. It will be available until the conference. Until then, this page is under construction, and we may not be able to properly and efficiently review requests.

## Terms of usage

Individual images may be subjected to copyright restrictions. Therefore, we are not making the images directly available.
